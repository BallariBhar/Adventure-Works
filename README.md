# Adventure-Works
This project analyzes the AdventureWorks sample dataset to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
The goal was to simulate a real world business analytics workflow: from querying raw data using SQL to building interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau for decision making.
